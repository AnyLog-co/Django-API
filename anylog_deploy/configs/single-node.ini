# The following provides the different parameters needed by AnyLog-API to deploy an AnyLog instance.
# A user should update a copy of this file, as they may need more than one file depending on their deployment.
# Please note, configs with a hashtag ("#") next to it are optional.

[general]
# AnyLog version to download from Docker Hub
#   develop - code that has been tested and used for a while
#       alpine version: alpine
#       arm64 version: develop-arm64 | alpine-arm64
#   predevelop - code currently being tested
#       alpine version: predevelop-alpine
#       arm64 version: predevelop-arm64 | predevelop-alpine-arm64
build=predevelop

# Type of node AnyLog should run - users can specify more than one node type in a single instance with comma separating them
#   master - a "notary" system between other nodes in the network via either a public or private blockchain
#   operator - nodes containing generated by sensors. these can be either physical devices (ex. cars) or remote cloud
#   publisher - nodes that simply generate data and send them to operator nodes
#   query - nodes dedicated to query and BI activity
node_type=master,operator,query


# Name correlated with the node. This will also be used as the container name if deploying AnyLog within AnyLog-API
node_name=anylog-test-single-node

# The name of the company correlated with policies declared via this node
company_name=AnyLog Co

# Machine location - If user doesn't declare --disable-location & location isn't set, then AnyLog-API has a process to find the location of the machine
# Note, coordinates location is accessible via Grafana Map visualization
