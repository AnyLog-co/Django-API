# The following provides the different parameters needed by AnyLog-API to deploy an AnyLog instance.
# A user should update a copy of this file, as they may need more than one file depending on their deployment.
# Please note, configs with a hashtag ("#") next to it are optional.

[general]
# Type of node AnyLog should run - users can specify more than one node type in a single instance with comma separating them
#   master - a "notary" system between other nodes in the network via either a public or private blockchain
#   operator - nodes containing generated by sensors. these can be either physical devices (ex. cars) or remote cloud
#   publisher - nodes that simply generate data and send them to operator nodes
#   query - nodes dedicated to query and BI activity
node_type=master

# AnyLog version to download from Docker Hub
#   develop - code that has been tested and used for a while
#       alpine version: alpine
#       arm64 version: develop-arm64 | alpine-arm64
#   predevelop - code currently being tested
#       alpine version: predevelop-alpine
#       arm64 version: predevelop-arm64 | predevelop-alpine-arm64
build=predevelop

# Name correlated with the node. This will also be used as the container name if deploying AnyLog within AnyLog-API
node_name=anylog-test-master

# The name of the company correlated with policies declared via this node
company_name=AnyLog Co.

# Machine location - If user doesn't declare --disable-location & location isn't set, then AnyLog-API has a process to find the location of the machine
# Note, coordinates location is accessible via Grafana Map visualization
#location=<location> 

[authentication]
# whether or not to enable authentication
authentication=on

# authentication username and password
username=anylog
password=demo

# authentication type
#   admin
#   user
auth_type=admin

# credentials expiration (ex. 2 days)
#expiration=<auth_expiration>

[networking] 
# TCP connection information for master node
master_node=10.0.0.231:2048

# TCP port for node used to communicate with other nodes in the network. Please make sure the port is open and available
anylog_tcp_port=2048

# REST port for node used to communicate with other nodes in the network. Please make sure the port is open and available
anylog_rest_port=2049 

# a local MQTT broker is supported on Publisher & Operator respectively
# Enable local broker
#local_broker=<local_broker>

# AnyLog Broker Port
#anylog_broker_port=<anylog_broker_port>  

[database]
# Logical database name within operator node
#default_dbms=<db_name>

# Type of database to be used by the AnyLog node
#    PSQL
#    SQLite
db_type=psql

# Database credentials -- ${db_user}@{db_ip}:${db_user_password}
db_user=anylog@127.0.0.1:demo
