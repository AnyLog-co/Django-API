# The following provides the different parameters needed by AnyLog-API to deploy an AnyLog instance.
# A user should update a copy of this file, as they may need more than one file depending on their deployment.
# Please note, configs with a hashtag ("#") next to it are optional.

[general]
# AnyLog version to download from Docker Hub
#   develop - code that has been tested and used for a while
#       alpine version: alpine
#       arm64 version: develop-arm64 | alpine-arm64
#   predevelop - code currently being tested
#       alpine version: predevelop-alpine
#       arm64 version: predevelop-arm64 | predevelop-alpine-arm64
build=<build_type>

# Type of node AnyLog should run - users can specify more than one node type in a single instance with comma separating them
#   master - a "notary" system between other nodes in the network via either a public or private blockchain
#   operator - nodes containing generated by sensors. these can be either physical devices (ex. cars) or remote cloud
#   publisher - nodes that simply generate data and send them to operator nodes
#   query - nodes dedicated to query and BI activity
node_type=<node_type>

# Name correlated with the node. This will also be used as the container name if deploying AnyLog within AnyLog-API
node_name=<node_name> 

# The name of the company correlated with policies declared via this node
company_name=<company_name>

# Machine location - If user doesn't declare --disable-location & location isn't set, then AnyLog-API has a process to find the location of the machine
# Note, coordinates location is accessible via Grafana Map visualization
#location=<location> 

[authentication]
# whether or not to enable authentication
authentication=false

# authentication username and password
#username=<auth_username>
#password=<auth_password>

# authentication type
#   admin
#   user
#auth_type=<auth_type>

# credentials expiration (ex. 2 days)
#expiration=<auth_expiration>

[networking]
# An option to change the external & local IP if different than what the machine is configured to. This option is most often
# used for 2 key cases
#   1) When a machine is connected to more than one network, and the system should use a specific one, rather than
#      taking the default IP(s)
#   2) When the machine seats behind a fire wall, and wants both the external (and local) IP to be the same
#external_ip=<external_ip>
#local_ip=<local_ip>

# TCP connection information for master node
master_node=<master_node>  

# TCP port for node used to communicate with other nodes in the network. Please make sure the port is open and available

[database]
# Logical database name within operator node

#    PSQL
#    SQLite
db_type=<db_type>

# Database credentials -- ${db_user}@{db_ip}:${db_user_password}
db_user=<db_user>

# Database access port

[cluster]
# set operator as part of a cluster (True) or not (False)

cluster_name=<cluster_name>

[partition]
# Operator only - whether or not to partition the data stored.

# timestamp column to partition against
#partition_column=<timestamp_column>

# Interval to partition against (ex. 7 days)
#   hour
#   day

#partition_interval=<partition_interval>


[mqtt]
# Run an MQTT client as part of the node (Publisher & Operator only) - if MQTT client has more than 2 columns use the `--deployment-file` option
